# OOPS-PROJECT

OVERVIEW
There is a total of 9(clubs) and 4(committees) in our institute with numerous students as their part and are responsible for conducting most of the Technical and Cultural activities and events 
for the students, under the guidance of Professors and Institute. These clubs over the years have formed a whole different community within a community. All members stay close and form a 
bond with each other, everybody is treated like a family. But many-a-times it becomes very difficult to manage these clubs and committees, therefore the aim of our project is to make 
something that makes the task of managing these clubs and committees easier.

Hence, we are creating a program to implement “Club Management System” using the concepts of OOP’s (Object Oriented Programming) like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, 
Encapsulation etc.
